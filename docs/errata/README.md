# Errata and Improvements

If you find any mistakes in the sixth edition, *C# 10 and .NET 6 - Modern Cross-Platform Development*, or if you have suggestions for improvements, then please [raise an issue in this repository](https://github.com/markjprice/cs11dotnet7/issues) or email me at markjprice (at) gmail.com.

[**Errata** (58 items)](errata.md): Typos in the text of the book, mistakes in the code that would cause a compilation error that prevents a successful build, and changes to the user interfaces or behavior of tools after final drafts.

[**Improvements** (33 items)](improvements.md): Changes to text or code that would improve the content. These are optional.

Errata and improvements submitted before mid-September 2022 have been incorporated into the [7th edition](https://github.com/markjprice/cs11dotnet7).
